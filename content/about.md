We are a student run organization in the Bay Area founded in the Spring of 2021. We are composed of middle and high schoolers across many schools and our goal is to provide performance opportunities for youth musicians by allowing them opportunities to play at various Farmers Markets. We have donated to organizations around the world, including UNICEF, Calfire, and more. We try to improve ourselves as musicians and performers while raising money for charities.
