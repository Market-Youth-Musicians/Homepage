Emergency! Only a few days before September 5th, 2021, MYM received a call for help at the Moraga Farmers Market, about a 1 hour drive from where most of us live. (Moraga Way &, Moraga Rd, Moraga, CA 94556) Even though only two of us were able to make it, it was nevertheless an amazing experience.

Judy and Michelle on Harp and Violin arrived there 15 minutes to 9. Our stall was situated on the edge of the stalls. It was facing the inside with the back facing the outside roads. There was a tree giving us shade as well. 

Everybody was super nice, and can I say, I have never seen so many toddlers, strollers, and little people! It was absolutely great, but since we had to travel through some mountains and super expensive houses (just telling the truth here), we were expecting more senior people, maybe even a few UC Berkeley professors or two. Just joking.

The market managers there were super nice. They gave the music stall spaces on the side, so instead of blocking the way, many people were able to stand there and watch us play. It really does feel nice again to perform for people and to feel the eyes of little people on us as well! And once again, Ave Maria is still a people’s favorite. :)

And, that is one nice Boston hat! :)
